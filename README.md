github-email-notifications
==========================

Better email notifications from github with clear, concise, and readable
messages.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapel-lang/github-email-notifications.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapel-lang/github-email-notifications) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/chapel-lang/github-email-notifications/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/chapel-lang/github-email-notifications?branch=master)

Simple python web application for Heroku that accepts github webhooks for
["push" events][push_events] and generates a clear, concise, and readable email
message.

It is designed to meet the [Chapel][chapel] team's needs, as the email hook
provided by github is rather noisy and it looks unlikely to change. The Chapel
project uses the [feature branch workflow][fb_workflow], and always includes a
nice summary in the merge commit messages. So, the merge message (actually the
head commit in the push event) is the only one included in the email.

Heroku Setup
------------

Create the app, enable papertrail to record logs, and set the configuration
variables.  Note: if you have more than one Heroku app associated with your
login, most heroku command lines after "create" (see below) should include 
"-a <app_name>" on the end of the command line.  You can also do everything 
from the Heroku web page, https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/<app_name>, 
instead of the command line- however, that's not shown here.

```bash
# heroku login
  # Create your own login, or use 
  # chapel_github@cray.com + password from Keeppass.
  # After the first time, the heroku login persists somewhere for a while
heroku create <app_name>
heroku addons:add papertrail
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SEND_FROM_AUTHOR=<true>
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SENDER=<sender_email>
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_RECIPIENT=<recipient_email>
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SECRET=<the_secret>
```

An optional "RECIPIENT_CC" e-mail address may be given, in which case the messages
are Cc'd to that address. 

```bash
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_RECIPIENT_CC=<Cc_email>
```

If `GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SEND_FROM_AUTHOR` is set (to any value), the pusher
name and email combination will be used as the "From" address instead of the
configured sender value. If a reply-to is configured, see below, that will be
added regardless of this setting.

Optionally, a reply-to address can be configured with the following config. If
not set, no reply-to header is set so the sender address will be used as reply
address.

```bash
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_REPLY_TO=<reply_to_email>
```

Optionally, an "Approved" header value can be configured. The Approved header
automatically approves the messages for a read-only or moderated mailing list.

```bash
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_APPROVED_HEADER=<approved_header>
```

SendGrid Setup
--------------

Enable addon, and disable the plain text to html conversion:

```bash
heroku addons:add sendgrid
heroku addons:open sendgrid
```

* Go to "Settings"-> "Mail Settings".
* Activate "Plain Content - Convert your plain text emails to HTML."
  (ie, "Turn on if you don't want to convert your plain text email to HTML" -
  we want plain content, not HTML)

Rollbar Setup
-------------

Rollbar provides error tracking, in case anything unexpected happens. Enable
the addon and optionally set the environment name.

```bash
heroku addons:add rollbar
```

Optionally, set the environment name for rollbar. This is probably only
necessary if you have multiple environment configured to use rollbar.

```bash
heroku config:set GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_ROLLBAR_ENV=<env_name>
```

Deploy the Heroku App
---------------------

I found this easier to do from the Heroku web page,
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/<app_name>/deploy/github. (ie, Heroku 
dashboard for app <app_name>, "Deploy" tab, deployment method "GitHub"). 
If you "connect" the Heroku app to this GitHub repo, you can Deploy right
from there. Because "connecting" means allowing auto authentication
to GitHub from Heroku, I preferred not to Deploy as chapel_github@cray.com. 
Instead, I deployed from my personal Heroku account, which I added to the
Heroku app as a "collaborator" (see "Access" tab). 

GitHub Setup
------------

Add webhook to repo to use this emailer. Be sure to set the secret to the value
of `GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SECRET` (you are free to generate any string). 
The webhook URL is `<heroku_url>/commit-email` and it must send "push" events in
JSON format. Show the heroku app url with:

```bash
heroku domains
```

Development
-----------

To develop and test locally, install the [Heroku Toolbelt][0], python
dependencies, create a `.env` file, and use `heroku local:start` to run the app.

* Install python dependencies (assuming virtualenvwrapper is available):

```bash
mkvirtualenv github-email-notifications
# if not found, source virtualenvwrapper.sh and retry
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create `.env` file with chapel config values:

```
GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SENDER=<email>
GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_RECIPIENT=<email>
GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAILER_SECRET=<the_secret>
ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=<rollbar_token>
SENDGRID_PASSWORD=<sendgrid_password>
SENDGRID_USERNAME=<sendgrid_user>
```

To use the same values configured in heroku:

```bash
# heroku login
  # chapel_github@cray.com + password from Keeppass
  # after the first time, the heroku login persists somewhere for a while
heroku config --shell > .env
```

* Run the app, which opens at `http://localhost:5000`:

```bash
heroku local:start
```

* Send a test request:

```bash
curl -vs -X POST \
  'http://localhost:5000/commit-email' \
  -H 'x-github-event: push' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"deleted": false,
    "ref": "refs/heads/master",
    "compare": "http://compare.me",
    "repository": {"full_name": "test/it"},
    "head_commit": {
      "id": "mysha1here",
      "message": "This is my message\nwith a break!",
      "added": ["index.html"],
      "removed": ["removed.it"],
      "modified": ["stuff", "was", "done"]},
    "pusher": {
      "name": "awallace",
      "email": "testing@github-email-notification.info"}}'
```

Note: the above test will not actually send an email, because
```WARNING:root:Invalid signature, skipping request```

* Install test dependencies and run the unittests.

```bash
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
tox
tox -e flake8
tox -e coverage
```
